# Predicting-Airline-Delays
Predicting Airline arrival and departure delay using Machine Learning

Summary and Motivation: 
Flight delays are a major problem for individual customers and also for the airlines and the US economy in general.
In 2016, there has been a 17% delay in the arrival of flights and 18% delay in the departure of flights consequently causing in 78% propagational delays leading to a major loss in US economy.

Highlights:
In our project we are trying to understand the causes for delay and expected delays for a given flight in the future. Our project deals with the following questions:

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Which Airports have the Most Delays?
Which routes are typically encounter the most delays?
What is the largest cause of delay in the US National Airspace System (like inclement weather, air traffic issues etc.)? 
Which airports have the worst weather-related delay?
What type of weather causes the most delay?

Model Building:
Whether you flight will encounter delay or not based on various parameters such as Time of day, Day of Week, Month, etc.?
How much delay will occur quantitatively?


Data Sets:
The official flight database for every domestic flight in the US, using 2016 data.
